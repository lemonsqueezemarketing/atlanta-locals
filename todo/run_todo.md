# To-Do: run.py

- [ ] Confirm Flask app import path is correct.
- [ ] Check that debug mode is only enabled in development.
- [ ] Ensure host and port values are configurable via environment variables.
- [ ] Add error handling for failed app starts.
- [ ] If using `.env`, verify it loads before app initialization.
- [ ] Consider removing this file entirely in production in favor of `wsgi.py`.
