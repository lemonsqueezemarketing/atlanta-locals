# To-Do: config.py

- [ ] Audit all configuration variables for sensitive information â€” move secrets to environment variables.
- [ ] Ensure all default values are set for development, staging, and production environments.
- [ ] Consider splitting configurations into separate classes (DevelopmentConfig, ProductionConfig, TestingConfig).
- [ ] Add comments explaining purpose of each config variable for maintainability.
- [ ] Validate file paths and URLs to prevent runtime errors in different environments.
- [ ] Check for redundant or unused configuration variables and remove them.
