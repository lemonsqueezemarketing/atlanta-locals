# To-Do: requirements.txt

- [ ] Audit for unused dependencies and remove them to reduce security risk and package bloat.
- [ ] Pin all dependency versions to prevent unexpected behavior after updates.
- [ ] Add comments for each major dependency explaining its purpose in the project.
- [ ] Check for and upgrade any dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Consider creating a `requirements-dev.txt` for development-only dependencies (e.g., testing tools, linters).
- [ ] Verify compatibility with current Python version.
