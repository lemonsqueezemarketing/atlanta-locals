# To-Do: main.py

- [ ] Review and remove unused imports to improve load time and readability.
- [ ] Ensure logging is consistent and informative for debugging.
- [ ] Centralize configuration values (e.g., app settings, keys) into a `config.py` file.
- [ ] Add error handling for any top-level operations that could fail.
- [ ] Confirm that app initialization order matches dependencies (e.g., DB init before blueprint registration).
- [ ] Consider adding a debug flag or environment variable to toggle dev/production behavior.
