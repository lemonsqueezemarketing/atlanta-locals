    "# Blog Post API CRUD Testing Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to test the **CRUD functionality** of the Blog Post API \n",
    "built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and MongoDB (for content storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests directly to the running \n",
    "Gunicorn server (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Verify connectivity** — ensure the API responds correctly to requests.\n",
    "2. **Test CRUD operations**:\n",
    "   - **Create** new blog posts (`POST`)\n",
    "   - **Read** existing blog posts (`GET`)\n",
    "   - **Update** existing blog posts (`PUT`/`PATCH`)\n",
    "   - **Delete** blog posts (`DELETE`)\n",
    "3. **Validate payload structure** — confirm the JSON structure matches what \n",
    "   the API expects and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will serve as a safe, Python-based testing environment before \n",
    "integrating the API calls with the JavaScript frontend.\n"

It is the primary domestic hub for connections across the Southeast and a major international gateway linking North America to Europe, Latin America, and Africa. Its central location, dense flight network, and operational efficiency make it a linchpin for both leisure and business travel.', 'paragraph-2': 'For Atlanta’s economy, ATL is more than a transit point—it’s a growth engine. The airport directly and indirectly supports tens of thousands of jobs, fuels hospitality and logistics industries, and serves as a critical factor in corporate site selection. Companies expand in Atlanta because executives, talent, and customers can reach the city quickly and reliably.', 'paragraph-3': 'From a traveler’s perspective, ATL’s scale translates into options: multiple daily departures to most major U.S. cities, competitive fares, and robust amenities—from culinary upgrades to art installations. Understanding ATL’s layout, peak times, and transit tips can dramatically improve the experience for first-timers and frequent flyers alike.', 'title': 'ATL at a Glance: Why This Airport Matters'}, 'section-2': {'paragraph-1': 'ATL’s airside complex features two terminals (Domestic and International/Maynard H. Jackson Jr.) connected to a series of concourses (T through F). An underground Plane Train moves passengers between concourses in minutes, while moving walkways offer an alternative for those who prefer to stay topside. Clear signage and frequent announcements help guide passengers during tight connections.', 'paragraph-2': 'Security screening is handled across multiple checkpoints. CLEAR and TSA PreCheck can significantly reduce wait times, especially during morning rush (6–9 a.m.) and late afternoon peaks (4–7 p.m.). If you’re connecting, you’ll usually remain airside and won’t need to re-clear security unless you exit the sterile area.', 'paragraph-3': 'For landside navigation, rideshare pick-up zones, MARTA rail access, and rental car facilities are all clearly indicated. The SkyTrain connects the domestic terminal with rental cars and nearby hotels, while MARTA’s Red/Gold lines deliver a fast, inexpensive ride to Midtown, Buckhead, and Downtown.', 'title': 'Layout, Terminals, and Getting Around'}, 'section-3': {'paragraph-1': 'Book earlier flights when possible—morning departures typically face fewer knock-on delays caused by weather or aircraft rotations. Build in buffer time for tight connections, especially if your itinerary crosses long concourse distances or switches between domestic and international terminals.', 'paragraph-2': 'Monitor your flight via the airline’s mobile app and enable push notifications for gate changes or rebooking prompts. If irregular operations arise, being first in the digital queue often yields better options. Also consider packing a small ‘resilience kit’—portable charger, snacks, and a refillable water bottle.', 'paragraph-3': 'Dining and lounge choices are widespread across concourses. If you’re an infrequent flyer, day-pass lounge access can be worth it during long delays. For families, identify kid-friendly spaces and nearby restrooms before you settle in, and confirm stroller policies in advance to streamline security.', 'title': 'Tips to Minimize Delays and Stress'}, 'section-4': {'paragraph-1': 'MARTA rail puts ATL within easy reach of Downtown meeting venues and the Georgia World Congress Center. It’s also a straight shot to Midtown’s tech corridor and Buckhead’s financial district. Rideshare is abundant, but surge pricing can appear during big events or evening storms.', 'paragraph-2': 'If you plan to rent a car, factor in ATL traffic patterns. I-85/I-75 northbound can slow during rush hours; alternatives like surface streets or shifting your schedule by 15–30 minutes can save time. Visitors staying near the BeltLine will find excellent dining and nightlife in Old Fourth Ward, Inman Park, and Poncey-Highland.', 'paragraph-3': 'Hotel options range from on-airport properties to boutique stays near Midtown’s arts scene. If you have less than 24 hours, consider a rail trip to the High Museum of Art or a foodie run at Ponce City Market for a quick taste of the city.', 'title': 'Ground Transportation and Nearby Neighborhoods'}, 'section-5': {'paragraph-1': 'For outbound international flights, arrive earlier than you would for domestic—generally two to three hours ahead. Verify passport validity (typically six months minimum) and eVisa or ESTA requirements depending on your destination.', 'paragraph-2': 'Inbound international passengers clear Customs and Border Protection in the International Terminal (Concourse F). If connecting onward within the U.S., follow the re-check instructions for baggage and leave extra time in case of long queues. Global Entry can significantly speed up arrival formalities.', 'paragraph-3': 'Currency exchange is available but rates may be better through your bank or at destination ATMs. Most Atlanta vendors accept tap-to-pay and mobile wallets, making cash optional for short stays.', 'title': 'International Travel Essentials'}, 'section-6-conclusion': {'paragraph-1': 'ATL rewards travelers who plan. Whether it’s leveraging TSA PreCheck, choosing earlier departures, or learning the concourse layout, a bit of preparation turns one of the world’s busiest airports into a smooth waypoint. Keep an eye on the weather, monitor your airline’s app, and build time buffers where possible.', 'paragraph-2': 'If you’re visiting Atlanta, treat the airport as a launchpad to an eclectic city with world-class dining, culture, and parks. With a smart itinerary, you’ll spend less time waiting at the gate and more time enjoying the city—or arriving at your next destination on schedule.', 'paragraph-3': 'Use these tips as a checklist the next time you book through ATL.
