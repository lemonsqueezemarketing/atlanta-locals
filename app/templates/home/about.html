    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Even with the latest tools, apps, and technology, local business discovery is broken.
      Many Atlanta locals struggle to find their favorite neighborhood businesses simply because they don’t show up in search results.
      Meanwhile, business owners are often overlooked online because they can't afford the $5,000+ per month required to compete with big-budget marketing teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates a circular challenge: locals can't find the businesses they love, and those businesses can’t afford to get found.

    <h2>A Word From the Founder</h2>
    <p>
      I sought out to fix this problem. Using my background in business, marketing, and technology, I made it my mission to help local businesses show up online — especially in local search results.
      One of our winning use cases? <strong>Classic Fades Barbershop</strong>. (See full story.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But even we hit a wall. To truly unleash the power of SEO, we needed a full team — designers, copywriters, developers, producers, marketers. And that requires capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if we streamlined the process?
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, the purpose of Local SEO is to help real people discover real businesses. So, why not build a local search engine designed by ATL for ATL?

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      We’re building a custom local experience — powered by local directory APIs, supported by real people on the ground in Atlanta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our search engine is Atlanta-built, Atlanta-run. We don’t just market to small businesses, we connect with them — in person. We take the time to understand their challenges and create actual solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn’t just SEO. It’s a local movement.
